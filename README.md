# 🚀 Reddit Data Engineering Pipeline

A scalable data pipeline that extracts Reddit posts and comments, stores them in Amazon S3, transforms the data using AWS Glue and Athena, and loads it into Amazon Redshift for analytics — orchestrated with Apache Airflow.

## 🔍 Overview

This project builds an end-to-end **data engineering pipeline** that:

- Extracts Reddit data (posts, comments) using the official [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/). 
- Stores raw JSON data in **Amazon S3**.
- Uses **Apache Airflow** to orchestrate ETL workflows.
- Leverages **AWS Glue** and **Amazon Athena** for schema management and transformations.
- Loads cleaned data into **Amazon Redshift** for querying and visualization.

It's ideal for analyzing trends, sentiment, or user behavior from Reddit communities.
